# How to add/update worlds

- Add an `{apworld}.toml` file in the `index/` directory. The name of the file **MUST** match the apworld name. So for `A link to the Past` which apworld is `alttp`, you would create a file named `alttp.toml`.
- In the `toml` file, add a name, `name = "A Link to the Past`. That name **MUST** match the world name. If you're unsure what that means, it's the name used in your YAML.
- If the `name` field is nondescriptive or "ugly", add a `display_name` field with a pretty name. This especially useful for manuals where the name is `Manual_{game}_{author}`. In that case, add a `display_name` with `"Manual: {game}"`.
- Add a `home` field if applicable. In order of preference, it should contain a link to the discord thread, the github repo, any other webpage where the apworld might live. If there's none (i.e you made this apworld and it's not publically available anywhere else, omit the field).
- Add a `[versions]` section, one version per line. It should look something like this: `"{version}" = { src }`. Read the following sections to understand what that means.
  
## Version

Each version **MUST** be valid [semver](https://semver.org/). It doesn't matter if the apworld doesn't respect semver or doesn't even have a version that would be valid. We use this to make sure versions can be ordered.
If necessary, be creative with your version number.

For example, if an apworld has a release for a version `0.8`, you'd specify version `0.8.0` as the version the index.
If an apworld doesn't specify a version, as is usually the case with manuals, invent one. I tend to count the number of releases in the discord channel and name it `0.0.X`.
It's not always feasible though because of discord UX choices regarding search. It's fine to just go with `0.0.1`. When updating those apworlds, just increment the version number.

## Src

The index supports two different source types, `url` and `local`.
When possible, one should prefer `url` to avoid bloating the repo with apworlds.

Examples:

- The apworld is released on github and has a direct download link to the apworld in the release:
  `"0.1.0" = { url = "https://github.com/foo/bar/releases/0.1.0/download/foo.apworld" }`

- The apworld is only distributed on some discord channel or the release on github doesn't distribute the apworld. You would need to copy the apworld to the `apworlds` folder of the repository as `{apworld}-{version}.apworld`
  `"0.1.0" = { local = "../apworlds/foo-0.1.0.apworld" }`

### Special case for `url` releases

When the author uses tags that are semver compatible, it's possible to add a `default_url` field instead in the global scope of the toml like this:
`default_url = "https://github.com/foo/bar/releases/{{version}}/download/foo.apworld` and to specify versions like this: `"0.1.0" = {}`.
This makes it easier to update and can be used to automatically fetch newer versions so it's the prefered way of doing things.


# Criterias for inclusion

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do **NOT** go make demands for apworlds author to cater their apworlds for inclusion in this index.

- The apworld must not be banned on the archipelago server for copyright reasons
- The apworld must not contain big unknown executable binary blobs that we cannot trace back to trusted sources
- The apworld must not contain obvious flaws that will make life difficult for anyone trying to generate large multiworlds. That includes direct usage of the random module, obvious logic flaws, test failures that are deemed problematic...
- The apworld must not make any use of a remote resource during generation.
